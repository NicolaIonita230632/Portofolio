# Romanian Emotion Classification Pipeline

## Project Overview
End-to-end NLP pipeline for emotion classification in Romanian reality TV content, addressing the challenge of limited Romanian language NLP resources while delivering a production-ready solution for media content analysis.

## My Role: AI Engineer & Project Coordinator
**Primary Responsibilities:**
- Led technical architecture decisions for complete ML pipeline
- Coordinated 4-person cross-functional team through 8-week development cycle
- Managed project planning, risk assessment, and deliverable tracking via Trello
- Drove strategic decisions on model selection and resource constraints

**Technical Leadership:**
- Designed end-to-end solution from speech-to-text through emotion classification
- Implemented systematic model iteration and performance optimization
- Led integration of explainable AI components for model transparency
- Coordinated knowledge-sharing activities and technical presentations

## Business Impact & Problem Solved
**Challenge:** Media companies need automated emotion detection in Romanian language content, but existing NLP tools are primarily optimized for English, creating significant technical barriers.

**Solution:** Developed multilingual transformer-based pipeline that overcomes Romanian language limitations while maintaining production-ready performance standards.

**Value Delivered:**
- Automated emotion classification reducing manual annotation time by 90%
- Model transparency through XAI implementation for stakeholder trust
- Scalable architecture supporting 10,000+ audio samples processing
- Ethical AI framework with bias detection and mitigation strategies

### Technologies & Tools
- **Deep Learning:** Transformers, BERT, XLM-RoBERTa, PyTorch
- **NLP Processing:** Whisper, AssemblyAI, spaCy, Hugging Face
- **Explainable AI:** SHAP, LIME for model interpretability  
- **MLOps:** Weights & Biases for experiment tracking
- **Project Management:** Trello, systematic iteration logging
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy, custom Romanian text preprocessing

### Key Technical Challenges Overcome
1. **Limited Romanian NLP Resources**
   - **Challenge:** Most pre-trained models optimized for English
   - **Solution:** Strategic selection of multilingual XLM-RoBERTa architecture
   - **Impact:** Achieved competitive F1 scores despite language constraints

2. **Class Imbalance in Emotion Dataset**
   - **Challenge:** Uneven distribution of emotion categories
   - **Solution:** Implemented synonym replacement and weighted loss functions
   - **Impact:** Improved model performance across underrepresented emotions

3. **Model Transparency Requirements**
   - **Challenge:** Black-box nature of transformer models
   - **Solution:** Integrated SHAP and LIME for token-level explanations
   - **Impact:** Enabled stakeholder understanding of model decisions

## Model Performance & Results
- **Best Model:** Fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa achieving optimal F1 scores
- **Speech-to-Text:** Whisper selected based on WER analysis (outperformed AssemblyAI)
- **Error Analysis:** Systematic evaluation identifying model limitations and improvement areas
- **Iteration Tracking:** 3+ major model iterations with documented decision rationale

## Team Coordination & Leadership
**Project Management Approach:**
- Implemented detailed Trello boards with ILO tracking and deadline management
- Conducted regular stand-up meetings and peer feedback sessions
- Managed technical blockers (3-day LLM downtime) without timeline impact
- Facilitated knowledge-sharing presentations on "NLP for Social Good"

**Cross-Functional Collaboration:**
- Coordinated team members with varying technical backgrounds
- Balanced individual tasks with collaborative deliverables
- Maintained clear communication channels and documentation standards

## Skills Demonstrated for AI Product Management
- **Technical Product Vision:** End-to-end solution design from user requirements to deployment
- **Resource-Constrained Innovation:** Creative problem-solving with limited Romanian NLP tools  
- **Team Technical Leadership:** Guiding technical decisions while managing project deliverables
- **Stakeholder Communication:** Translating complex NLP concepts through presentations and documentation
- **Ethical AI Implementation:** Proactive bias detection and model transparency measures
- **Performance Optimization:** Systematic iteration with measurable improvements
- 
## Key Deliverables
- **Complete NLP Pipeline:** From audio input to emotion classification
- **Model Card:** Comprehensive documentation following ethical AI standards
- **XAI Analysis:** Token-level explanations for model transparency
- **Error Analysis:** Systematic evaluation with improvement recommendations
- **Technical Presentation:** Knowledge-sharing on social applications of NLP
